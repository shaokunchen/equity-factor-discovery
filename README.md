# Uncovering key drivers of equity prices using commodity, macro and alternative data.
The goal of this project is to discover the top factors that drive individual equity prices. 
I will compile a broad list of macroeconomic, commodity and alternative data inputs, then use dimensionality reduction to extract the key factors that explain specific equity movements. 

1. build a unified feature set (macro, commodity, other relevant data)
2. Identify the top 5 explanatory variables for each company
